1
00:00:01,145 --> 00:00:02,790
You are being watched.

2
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:05,634
The government has
a secret system,

3
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:07,928
a machine that spies on you

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,671
every hour of every day.

5
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:11,594
I know because

6
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:12,654
I built it.

7
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:15,381
I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,

8
00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:16,902
but it sees everything...

9
00:00:16,904 --> 00:00:19,687
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people,

10
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,123
people like you,

11
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:24,793
crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

12
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:28,146
They wouldn't act,
so I decided I would.

13
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:30,048
But I needed a partner--

14
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,718
Someone with the skills
to intervene.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,372
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

16
00:00:37,374 --> 00:00:39,307
You'll never find us.

17
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,343
But victim or perpetrator,

18
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:44,262
if you're number's up,
we'll find you.

19
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:49,541
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

20
00:00:53,722 --> 00:00:55,723
He's on his way there now.

21
00:00:55,725 --> 00:00:57,542
What do we assume he knows?

22
00:00:57,544 --> 00:01:00,529
Assume he knows everything.

23
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:19,914
All luggage and cartons
must be attended at all times.

24
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:23,268
Any items left unattended
will be removed by,

25
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,772
subject search
by the MTA Police.

26
00:01:26,774 --> 00:01:30,091
Thank you for your cooperation.

27
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:34,563
Final boarding call
for the eastbound express--

28
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:35,781
Track 18.

29
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:38,867
Final boarding call,
eastbound express-- Track 18.

30
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:40,435
All aboard.

31
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:44,272
No, thanks.
I don't drink coffee.

32
00:01:44,274 --> 00:01:46,875
Sencha green tea...

33
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:49,744
One sugar.

34
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,613
You've been paying attention.

35
00:01:51,615 --> 00:01:53,999
Relax, Finch.
It's just tea.

36
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:57,252
I haven't guessed
your favorite color yet.

37
00:01:57,254 --> 00:02:00,555
New number...

38
00:02:00,557 --> 00:02:02,140
Wallace Negel.

39
00:02:02,142 --> 00:02:03,958
Born in Germany, 1946,

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,678
immigrated to the US in 1980,

41
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,181
worked
in international export--

42
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:11,132
Good credit, perfect taxes.

43
00:02:11,134 --> 00:02:12,901
Wait a minute.
Are these dates right?

44
00:02:12,903 --> 00:02:14,152
You noticed.

45
00:02:14,154 --> 00:02:17,239
Negel hasn't made
a single electronic transaction

46
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:20,108
in his own name
since December of 1987.

47
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,160
So where has
he been for 24 years?

48
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:23,528
And why is he back?

49
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,780
I don't think there is a Negel.

50
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:28,200
Foreign background,
boring life,

51
00:02:28,202 --> 00:02:32,170
a job involving travel--
Spycraft 101.

52
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:34,039
This is an alias.

53
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,790
I've used dozens of them.

54
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:37,342
I think Negel is a cover.

55
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,377
So, where do we start?

56
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:42,830
Shortly before
he disappeared in 1987,

57
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,634
Negel purchased a cemetery plot
in the Bronx.

58
00:02:45,636 --> 00:02:49,020
I've checked.
It's still there.

59
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,023
Why does
a person who doesn't exist

60
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:53,475
need a cemetery plot?

61
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:54,976
Right?

62
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:58,029
- Might be worth a look.
- Hmm.

63
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:00,282
Where are you going?

64
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:03,201
If we're dealing
with a spy from the 1980s,

65
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:06,538
I know someone
who can provide us

66
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,624
with the kind of pre-digital
information we need--

67
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:14,028
Things I can't find
on computers.

68
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:22,354
All first editions,

69
00:03:22,356 --> 00:03:24,472
the best available
on German history.

70
00:03:24,474 --> 00:03:26,525
The entire span
of the cold war would do it,

71
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:28,694
but specifically, the 1980s.

72
00:03:28,696 --> 00:03:33,615
And I'll be needing something
more precise than books.

73
00:03:33,617 --> 00:03:36,919
I'm not sure what you mean.

74
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,755
How about the Soviet submarine
schematics that you sold

75
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:41,707
back to Russian intelligence
last year?

76
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,043
You register that income
with the IRS, FBI?

77
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:49,882
It'd be hard to run this store
from prison, don't you think?

78
00:03:56,005 --> 00:03:59,308
Row 18,

79
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,060
plot 20.

80
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:05,397
Hmm.

81
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,580
What was the name?

82
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:24,082
- Wallace Negel.
- Yeah.

83
00:04:24,084 --> 00:04:26,534
Before the country reunified,

84
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:28,470
east Germany was the greatest
surveillance state

85
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:29,922
the world has seen.

86
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:32,391
The Stasi knew everything.

87
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:35,260
I've read about them.
I'm a sucker for surveillance.

88
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:38,180
They had millions
of hours of wiretaps,

89
00:04:38,182 --> 00:04:40,649
sweat and body-odor samples.

90
00:04:40,651 --> 00:04:43,852
I just need a name
to go with an alias.

91
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:46,355
Real name Ulrich Kohl--

92
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:48,023
Part of an espionage team.

93
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:50,242
I've read
about the Stasi teams--

94
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:52,160
Kohl's unit
went around the world,

95
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,246
in and out of Western Europe
and the US.

96
00:04:54,248 --> 00:04:56,081
That's why he needed
the American papers.

97
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:58,083
The team hunted down
east German defectors

98
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,168
and neutralized them
before they could talk.

99
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,503
"Neutralized."

100
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:04,289
Where guys like him went,

101
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,843
people died.

102
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:09,378
Um...

103
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,298
How did you know
about the submarine schematics?

104
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,183
Told you...

105
00:05:15,185 --> 00:05:17,603
I'm a sucker for surveillance.

106
00:05:17,605 --> 00:05:20,772
Looks like Kohl was in Europe
when the wall fell.

107
00:05:20,774 --> 00:05:22,608
Western authorities
were hunting him,

108
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,394
so he ran to hide
in the Soviet Union.

109
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:27,362
His wife, Anja,

110
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:30,098
who worked as a secretary
at Stasi headquarters,

111
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,117
ran with him,

112
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:35,404
but she was killed
in a car accident shortly after.

113
00:05:35,706 --> 00:05:37,539
That was in 1987.

114
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:42,127
By '89, east Germany
has collapsed.

115
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:46,749
The Stasi no longer exists,
and Kohl...

116
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,683
Was never heard from again.

117
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:50,352
Well, he's here now.

118
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:51,937
Negel's cemetery plot--

119
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:55,423
It was a buried stash kit.
He dug it up a few hours ago.

120
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:56,758
What do you think was in it?

121
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,444
If it was anything
like the ones I used to bury,

122
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:03,148
IDs, weapons, definitely money.

123
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:06,568
So it seems Kohl,
the spy, is back.

124
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:26,805
Hauffe.

125
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:30,592
Sorry?

126
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,177
Can I help you?

127
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:42,404
It can't be you.

128
00:06:48,662 --> 00:06:50,812
We have something to discuss.

129
00:06:58,382 --> 00:06:59,615
You're the new guy, right?

130
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:02,701
Let's go somewhere private
so we can talk.

131
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:06,288
You're Stanton?
I'm--

132
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,772
No, you're not.

133
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,825
The ID NCS gave you
didn't pass muster,

134
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:11,577
so you're nobody,

135
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,447
which means I get to name you.

136
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,717
Wilson, maybe.

137
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,803
No.
You should have a drink.

138
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,622
I don't drink when I'm working.

139
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:25,674
No?
Well, start.

140
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:28,343
You tier one boys
are all the same--

141
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:29,461
Tense.

142
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:32,797
Out here,
"tense" gets us killed.

143
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:34,650
In your old job,
you were behind enemy lines

144
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:37,686
for 6, 12 months?

145
00:07:37,688 --> 00:07:40,689
In this job, you never go back,

146
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:43,358
because there is no line
to cross back over.

147
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,313
Never was.
Understand?

148
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:51,650
So you may as well
get comfortable.

149
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:58,290
When you were in transit,

150
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:00,258
did you see any old friends?

151
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,927
No.

152
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:04,346
Why are you asking?

153
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:22,197
We know
about the ex-girlfriend.

154
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,815
Like I told you,

155
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:26,017
you never go back.

156
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,378
The coin Kohl dropped...

157
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,131
Was an east German mark.

158
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:43,502
They've been out of circulation
everywhere since 1990,

159
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,754
but I found a rare-coin
exchange in the city

160
00:08:45,756 --> 00:08:48,757
where a whole set of marks
was sold this morning.

161
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,011
Let me guess,
the seller was Ulrich Kohl.

162
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:54,763
Correct.

163
00:08:54,765 --> 00:08:58,817
He used the store's phone,
waited for an answer, hung up.

164
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:02,070
I traced the call to that
address in the west village--

165
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,906
Apartment 4A.

166
00:09:08,828 --> 00:09:12,063
Finch, we're too late.

167
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:23,458
Kohl called to make sure
he was home.

168
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:29,347
He was interrogated.

169
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,584
I'm going through
more of these records.

170
00:09:32,586 --> 00:09:35,053
Kohl was part
of a four man team.

171
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:36,471
He shared trigger duties

172
00:09:36,473 --> 00:09:38,473
with a team leader
named Steiller.

173
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:42,477
They were backed by a document
forger named Wernick...

174
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:43,895
Ah.

175
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:45,764
And they reported
to a case officer

176
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,566
named Hauffe for orders.

177
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,034
So who's this dead guy?

178
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:53,121
The apartment
is leased to Andrew Honem--

179
00:09:53,123 --> 00:09:56,825
An unmarried,
retired architect.

180
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,787
Kohl's job
was killing defectors.

181
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:17,229
Sounds like this guy
might have been one.

182
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:19,731
Hang on, Finch.

183
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:41,453
Half the intelligence services
in the world

184
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:43,338
were tracking
these guys at one point.

185
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,708
But they were ghosts--
Untraceable.

186
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:52,631
Finch, what was the case
officer's name again?

187
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,050
Hauffe.

188
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,303
This dead guy was Hauffe.

189
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:01,139
Kohl killed his Stasi teammate.

190
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:02,524
And he will kill again.

191
00:11:02,526 --> 00:11:06,778
I don't know who you are
or how you know to be here,

192
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,947
but this is just the beginning.

193
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,817
Then this is gonna be
a long day.

194
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:29,868
Finch, I got company.

195
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,306
BND--
German intelligence.

196
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,224
He seemed to know
what went down here.

197
00:11:36,226 --> 00:11:40,061
He also seemed sure
Kohl would kill again.

198
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,184
Detective Fusco.

199
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:49,771
Anonymous tip for you, Lionel.

200
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,240
You got to stop
calling me here.

201
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,992
Homicide in the west village.

202
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:56,278
I think the shooter might have
others planned today.

203
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,948
I left you a care package
at the scene.

204
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,367
I need you to find out
whatever he knows.

205
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:03,702
Yeah, well, I can't do anything

206
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:04,836
till someone calls in a crime.

207
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:07,255
You'll get a call--
"Shots fired."

208
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:09,457
Were there shots fired?

209
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:13,879
There were now.

210
00:12:20,887 --> 00:12:22,587
Hauffe's dead.

211
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:24,522
Who's next on Kohl's hit list?

212
00:12:24,524 --> 00:12:26,892
I took an encrypted phone
from that German agent.

213
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:30,312
Every text is blocked except
for the one they were reading--

214
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:33,398
Julian Werner.

215
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,100
Werner is a Wall Street lawyer,

216
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,370
and...

217
00:12:38,372 --> 00:12:40,322
Werner is really Wernick--

218
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:42,240
The forger.

219
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:45,126
Kohl's entire team is living
under aliases in New York.

220
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:48,246
The perfect place
to disappear, right, Finch?

221
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:50,632
These people
were his teammates.

222
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:52,884
Why would he be hunting them
two decades later?

223
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:55,003
Kohl vanishes without a trace,

224
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:58,173
and his teammates end up
living cushy lives in New York.

225
00:12:58,175 --> 00:12:59,958
This could be revenge
for something--

226
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,593
Maybe more than we know.

227
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:03,628
- The wife's death?
- The car crash.

228
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,681
She died in '87,
the same year he disappeared.

229
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,434
And I know a staged accident
when I see it.

230
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:12,187
We need to get to Wernick
before Kohl does.

231
00:13:38,297 --> 00:13:40,715
I thought you were dead.

232
00:13:42,134 --> 00:13:45,720
Still with the needle, I see.

233
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,441
What is it coated with?

234
00:13:49,443 --> 00:13:52,560
Something fast.

235
00:13:52,562 --> 00:13:55,230
It's the least I could do
for an old colleague.

236
00:13:55,232 --> 00:13:57,532
How long have I got?

237
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:00,285
Long enough.

238
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,070
Where is your accent,
<i>Hauptmann?</i>

239
00:14:02,072 --> 00:14:04,823
We were advised...

240
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:06,992
To blend in America.

241
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:09,494
I saw Hauffe this morning.

242
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:11,913
He was a good case officer.

243
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:14,799
He kept information on you
all these years.

244
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:20,622
Do you remember...

245
00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:23,925
My Anja?

246
00:14:23,927 --> 00:14:25,260
I called Werner's assistant.

247
00:14:25,262 --> 00:14:27,929
He has lunch
at the same place every day.

248
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,681
I'm on my way.

249
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:31,649
I remember.

250
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:35,603
I didn't know they would go
after her, too.

251
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:38,690
But killing me won't bring
her back, Ulrich.

252
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:45,697
I told her
I would keep her safe.

253
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:48,533
What happened to you, Ulrich?

254
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,903
I paid...

255
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:53,421
For my sins,

256
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:57,275
for yours, for the team.

257
00:14:57,277 --> 00:15:01,212
The people who caught me
kept me in a hole,

258
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:05,467
but I never stopped thinking,
planning.

259
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:10,088
It was long ago.
I let myself forget.

260
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,141
I did not have that luxury.

261
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:16,694
It was wrong what we did.

262
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:22,734
You'll go after Steiller next?

263
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:25,370
Then...

264
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:30,158
Be at peace, my old friend.

265
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,917
Call 911.

266
00:15:42,122 --> 00:15:44,672
I need an ambulance
at 43 19th street--

267
00:15:44,674 --> 00:15:46,674
Craftbar Cafe.

268
00:15:46,676 --> 00:15:49,561
Ma'am, stand back, please.

269
00:15:49,563 --> 00:15:50,895
Excuse me.

270
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:54,966
Weak pulse, but tachycardic--
BP is 70/30.

271
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:57,085
Shallow respiration,
signs of internal asphyxia.

272
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:59,187
Convulsions--
Guy's having a seizure.

273
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,412
Hey!

274
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:21,226
You can't breathe.

275
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:23,895
You have foam in your nose
and your mouth.

276
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:25,814
It's hydrocyanic acid.

277
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:29,050
Now, they're going to find us
in four minutes.

278
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,220
I can save you,
but you need to talk.

279
00:16:35,358 --> 00:16:39,578
What did Kohl come for?
Why is he after all of you?

280
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,231
Kohl was killing
their informants.

281
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,168
The Americans wanted him gone.

282
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,953
So you gave them Kohl.

283
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:52,073
They offered us a new life.

284
00:16:52,075 --> 00:16:55,043
We traded Ulrich.

285
00:16:55,045 --> 00:16:57,679
You were his team...

286
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:00,182
His friends.

287
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,601
A soldier deserves better.

288
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:05,804
I give you these, and you live.

289
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:08,724
What happened
after you defected?

290
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:11,977
They told us
Kohl ran to the Soviets--

291
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,112
He and Anja.

292
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:17,098
The Americans went for him.

293
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:20,869
They got her, too.

294
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:22,738
The car accident.

295
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,656
Yes.

296
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:26,992
Who will Kohl go after next?

297
00:17:26,994 --> 00:17:28,143
St--

298
00:17:28,145 --> 00:17:30,412
Steiller...

299
00:17:30,414 --> 00:17:32,464
He defected
with the rest of you?

300
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,750
Hey?
What's his alias?

301
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:46,411
I kept the lawyer alive,
but Kohl's not done yet.

302
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:49,514
Kohl's team betrayed him,
and it got his wife killed.

303
00:17:49,516 --> 00:17:51,600
They preserved themselves
over him.

304
00:17:51,602 --> 00:17:53,735
This is as personal as it gets.

305
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:54,853
So where's Steiller?

306
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:56,988
Finch, I saw the exact same pin

307
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,107
in Hauffe's apartment.

308
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:05,330
The Volks American Society...

309
00:18:05,332 --> 00:18:07,582
Is an organization
for New York citizens

310
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,317
of German heritage.

311
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,319
When the Stasi team defected,

312
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,422
they wouldn't have been allowed
to contact each other.

313
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,173
A German organization
would give all three

314
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,042
a chance to meet in public.

315
00:18:19,213 --> 00:18:22,180
So, if Hauffe and Wernick
were members...

316
00:18:22,182 --> 00:18:24,382
Then Steiller
would have been, too.

317
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:27,886
There are two crime scenes--

318
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:29,938
One in the West Village,
the other near Wall Street.

319
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,190
Now, the same senior citizen
wearing a gray suit

320
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:33,859
was seen fleeing
both locations.

321
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:35,277
Wall Street?

322
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:37,279
That's where the ambulance
was jacked earlier, right?

323
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,346
It sure was.

324
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:39,981
Read the description
of who jacked it?

325
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:42,901
My guy?
How's he involved in this?

326
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:46,187
And this guy was found
unconscious at the first scene.

327
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,189
Nice bruises.

328
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,541
He say anything yet,

329
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:52,193
like who kicked
his ass sideways?

330
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:53,795
Yeah, two words--

331
00:18:53,797 --> 00:18:55,029
"Phone call."

332
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:57,031
Everything else is in German.

333
00:19:01,254 --> 00:19:03,672
Either of these guys
look familiar to you?

334
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,324
Now, we know
you're German intel.

335
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:07,559
We know a lot.

336
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:09,177
If that's all you know,
<i>polizei,</i>

337
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:10,645
then you don't know very much.

338
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,681
Yeah, why don't you tell me
about your homicidal geriatric?

339
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:20,021
Two crimes,
a very dangerous man at work,

340
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:22,557
and one agent trying
to stop a killer?

341
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,661
It'd be a shame if we <i>polizei</i>
couldn't help.

342
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:29,698
His name is Kohl.

343
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,566
He is a prisoner...

344
00:19:31,568 --> 00:19:34,286
Arrested in an operation between
my government and yours

345
00:19:34,288 --> 00:19:37,289
24 years ago.

346
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:40,842
He had become old,
feeble, they thought.

347
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:42,627
The order was given
to transfer him

348
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,596
to a minimum security facility.

349
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,014
And I'm guessing he escaped.

350
00:19:46,016 --> 00:19:48,550
He's smart and lethal.

351
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:50,468
And he killed Germans
for years.

352
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,803
There is nothing more important

353
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,588
than putting him back
where he belongs.

354
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,640
Why not involve US authorities?

355
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:58,476
He was jailed without trial.

356
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:01,396
Kohl isn't supposed to exist.

357
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:04,533
No one wants
an international incident.

358
00:20:04,535 --> 00:20:07,118
You aren't supposed to be
operating on US soil.

359
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,103
Where he goes,
people will keep dying.

360
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:10,822
Then help us.
We want the same thing.

361
00:20:10,824 --> 00:20:11,873
Don't say another word.

362
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:13,274
Hey, whoa,
this is an interrogation.

363
00:20:13,276 --> 00:20:15,660
- You can't be in here.
- This interview is over.

364
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:18,129
I am from the German consulate,

365
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:21,967
and this is
from the US State Department--

366
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:27,005
Orders to extradite him
back to Germany immediately.

367
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:30,959
The Volks American website
wasn't even using

368
00:20:30,961 --> 00:20:32,844
an open SSH secure proxy.

369
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,729
I cloned their log-in form
in seconds.

370
00:20:34,731 --> 00:20:36,264
Finch, the point?

371
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,316
I found the complete
membership roster.

372
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:39,818
Hauffe and Wernick
are both on it.

373
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,971
I'm running background checks
on the other members.

374
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:45,090
Here...
Michael Stegans--

375
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:46,975
Construction foreman
from Newark.

376
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:48,927
Credit scores
only go back to 1988.

377
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,478
If the pattern follows...

378
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,781
Then Stegans
is really Steiller.

379
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:57,035
He's running a construction
site in Brooklyn.

380
00:20:57,037 --> 00:20:58,653
I have a cell phone.

381
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,093
Hello?

382
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:07,345
Mr. Steiller?

383
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:09,330
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:11,850
I-I think you have
the wrong number.

385
00:21:11,852 --> 00:21:14,769
There's no time for games.
You need to listen.

386
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:17,722
Do you remember Ulrich Kohl?
He remembers you.

387
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:20,475
Just like he remembered
all his old Stasi colleagues.

388
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:22,560
He's on his way.

389
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:25,947
You're speaking of a dead man.

390
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:37,075
I knew this day would come.

391
00:21:37,077 --> 00:21:39,160
You were too good.

392
00:21:39,162 --> 00:21:41,079
I learned from the best.

393
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:43,715
I learned from you.

394
00:21:43,717 --> 00:21:46,751
You were my friend.

395
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:49,554
You knew me.

396
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:52,924
You knew my wife.

397
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:55,310
She trusted you
as much as I did.

398
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:57,545
You changed, Ulrich.

399
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,432
I watched what
the missions did to you--

400
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:03,184
The darkness in your eyes.

401
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:05,437
You believed in the killing.

402
00:22:05,439 --> 00:22:09,491
You trained me.
You made me what I was.

403
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:11,276
I believed in my country.

404
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:12,944
I believed in you.

405
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:14,729
We could not save you.

406
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:17,248
So you left Anja
and me to the hounds...

407
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,868
For some money and an apartment
in New York City?

408
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,202
I had to get out.

409
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:24,756
I was strong.
I survived.

410
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:27,742
What they did
to Anja, though...

411
00:22:27,744 --> 00:22:29,243
You will pay for that.

412
00:22:29,245 --> 00:22:32,630
Wait.
Wait, Ulrich.

413
00:22:33,766 --> 00:22:36,584
There is something
you don't know.

414
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:46,594
I was the only one who knew.

415
00:22:55,438 --> 00:22:57,122
Hello?

416
00:22:57,124 --> 00:23:00,441
Hello?

417
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,617
Anja is alive?

418
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:13,955
She found me a few years
after we all defected.

419
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:19,060
She was more afraid of you
than anyone, Ulrich.

420
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:21,479
So, you see,

421
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:26,101
your revenge
was all for nothing.

422
00:23:56,265 --> 00:23:58,833
Finch, we need to find Anja.

423
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:01,686
I think Kohl just added her
to his list.

424
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:07,721
The car accident was faked.

425
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:09,190
He was his wife,
and she betrayed him.

426
00:24:09,192 --> 00:24:10,491
To a man like Kohl,

427
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:13,161
that makes her
just as much a target.

428
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:17,198
We got a killer out there,

429
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,066
and our best lead
is getting deported.

430
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:20,785
You still got your vigilante
looking for the shooter.

431
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:22,236
That's not bad news.

432
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:24,238
You can't send a killer
to catch a killer, detective.

433
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,624
Hey, your guy
still gets results.

434
00:24:32,397 --> 00:24:34,882
They'll take side streets
to the airport--

435
00:24:34,884 --> 00:24:36,134
Standard procedure.

436
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:38,436
Tell detective Fusco to send
the GPS tracker number

437
00:24:38,438 --> 00:24:39,920
for the consulate car.

438
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,057
I found their position,
Mr. Reese,

439
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:45,193
but how do you intend
to stop them?

440
00:24:57,823 --> 00:25:00,374
Mr. Reese, I'm highly
uncomfortable being here.

441
00:25:00,376 --> 00:25:02,326
I'm highly uncomfortable
having you here,

442
00:25:02,328 --> 00:25:04,162
but I need a spotter.

443
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:18,810
Range it.

444
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,478
I don't know.
500 yards?

445
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,396
600.

446
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,517
45-degree oblique wind...

447
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,020
3/4 value wind speed.

448
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:30,688
Very impressive, Finch.

449
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,608
What if you miss?

450
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,810
I wouldn't know.
Never have.

451
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:50,341
Stop.
We have diplomatic immunity.

452
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:53,177
- I'm not a diplomat.
- Who are you?

453
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,013
I'm the guy who still has time
to save Anja Kohl.

454
00:25:56,015 --> 00:25:58,716
Now, I know she's alive,
but I need to know where.

455
00:25:58,718 --> 00:26:00,301
This man has nothing to say.

456
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:03,003
Any communication
would violate--

457
00:26:03,005 --> 00:26:06,173
There's nothing I can do.
Save her if you can.

458
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:15,983
Anna Klein-- An address
in Morningside Heights.

459
00:26:15,985 --> 00:26:17,451
It's Anja.

460
00:26:44,513 --> 00:26:46,180
Anja isn't here, Kohl.

461
00:26:46,182 --> 00:26:48,933
She's safe...

462
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:51,602
Where you can't get to her.

463
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:54,689
That's a Welrod, isn't it?

464
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:57,391
Only 73 decibels when fired.

465
00:26:57,393 --> 00:27:00,444
But it won't stop me
before I get to you.

466
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:04,332
And I lose my patience
when I get shot.

467
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:08,902
<i>Wo ist Anja?</i>

468
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:12,206
What's your plan, Kohl, hmm?

469
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:14,241
You gonna kill her, too...

470
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:15,509
Your own wife?

471
00:27:15,511 --> 00:27:20,214
You don't have a plan, do you?

472
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:26,103
Your external
carotid arteries--

473
00:27:26,105 --> 00:27:27,805
Obstruct both...

474
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,977
And you wake up
with quite a headache.

475
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:35,813
Ulrich?

476
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:38,032
It can't be.

477
00:27:38,034 --> 00:27:40,401
He's coming for me, isn't he?

478
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:41,819
Yes.

479
00:27:41,821 --> 00:27:44,038
What's important now is getting
you into police custody.

480
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,939
There's a detective
at the eighth precinct--

481
00:27:45,941 --> 00:27:47,658
No, wait.
We can't go yet.

482
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,160
It's safe there.
I promise.

483
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:52,046
Not yet, please.
I need to make a phone call.

484
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:54,749
A camera...

485
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,637
It's extraordinary.

486
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:02,890
The Stasi would have killed
for this technology.

487
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:06,427
<i>Wo ist Anja?</i>

488
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:13,401
When you travel,
you pick up things--

489
00:28:13,403 --> 00:28:16,070
Skills...

490
00:28:16,072 --> 00:28:17,071
Items.

491
00:28:17,073 --> 00:28:18,189
They all laughed at me

492
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:21,075
when I learned
to use these needles.

493
00:28:21,077 --> 00:28:23,577
They didn't laugh for long.

494
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,030
I was, uh...

495
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:29,617
Bagged by an insurgent patrol
when I was in Kandahar.

496
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:32,586
They used electricity on me...

497
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:34,872
16 hours.

498
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:37,041
All they wanted was my name.

499
00:28:37,043 --> 00:28:40,044
I don't care for your name.

500
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:42,680
The ulnar nerve
is the largest nerve

501
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:45,833
in the human body
that is unprotected.

502
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:49,169
It goes from the shoulder,
to the fingernail beds,

503
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:52,390
when it passes
through the elbow,

504
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:54,392
it's known as the funny bone.

505
00:28:55,862 --> 00:28:59,063
<i>Wo ist Anja?</i>

506
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:05,319
Relax.
We're on the same team.

507
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:09,156
And besides, where would
I hide a gun in this dress?

508
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:11,625
You're Stanton, right?

509
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,210
Who's this?

510
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,880
Haven't decided yet.

511
00:29:15,882 --> 00:29:18,332
Miller said you like bourbon.

512
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:20,217
You know what they drink here?

513
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,553
Plum brandy.

514
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:25,256
- A shame about Miller.
- What happened to him?

515
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:27,875
Wasn't getting the job done.

516
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:29,093
Word came down--

517
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:31,479
Time to take the gloves off.

518
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:35,316
So...
What can we do for you?

519
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:39,403
We're looking into reports
that Alim Assir

520
00:29:39,405 --> 00:29:41,272
was in country last week,

521
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:43,240
possibly to secure financing.

522
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:44,692
We sent all of our intel

523
00:29:44,694 --> 00:29:46,911
in the pouch
to Langley last week.

524
00:29:46,913 --> 00:29:49,447
And Assir made it
out of the country safely

525
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:50,915
two days ago.

526
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:52,450
We want to know how.

527
00:29:52,452 --> 00:29:54,568
That's also in our intel.

528
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,589
Like we said, he must have paid
customs a fortune.

529
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:02,126
And how much did he pay you?

530
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:07,431
Kidding.

531
00:30:07,433 --> 00:30:11,102
It's like I said--
You boys are too tense.

532
00:30:11,104 --> 00:30:14,889
Here's to taking
the gloves off.

533
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,098
You've got to be kidding me.

534
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,618
They didn't get very far,
did they?

535
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,954
Thank you.

536
00:30:29,956 --> 00:30:31,205
Remember our friend,

537
00:30:31,207 --> 00:30:33,741
the German agent
and his escort to JFK?

538
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:37,077
Apparently a guy in a suit
shot them off the road

539
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,914
with a high-caliber weapon.

540
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:41,499
I'm going to the scene,

541
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:46,003
see if my guy left a trail
that leads to Kohl.

542
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:55,179
- Detective Fusco.
- I need your help.

543
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:56,814
Look...

544
00:30:56,816 --> 00:30:58,298
First him, now you.

545
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,601
Look, you guys just can't ring
me up like I'm a bellhop.

546
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:02,520
Our mutual friend
went after your perpetrator,

547
00:31:02,522 --> 00:31:04,522
and I haven't heard from him--
Something's wrong.

548
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:06,524
This man may be more dangerous
than we anticipated.

549
00:31:06,526 --> 00:31:07,808
I need you to check on--

550
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,360
Look, I'm doing everything
I can to convince Carter

551
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:10,477
your boy's not a problem.

552
00:31:10,479 --> 00:31:11,862
Now you want me
to just walk off the job?

553
00:31:11,864 --> 00:31:13,948
Then you need to figure
something out-- It's urgent.

554
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,784
I'm sending you an address.

555
00:31:19,121 --> 00:31:21,154
Not getting a response?

556
00:31:21,156 --> 00:31:25,459
I know you don't know me,
but I'm someone who can help.

557
00:31:25,461 --> 00:31:28,796
You're gonna have
to kill me, Kohl.

558
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:31,331
Nobody enjoys taking life.

559
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,519
Killing is what I was good at.

560
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:38,055
I noticed.

561
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:41,341
That hydrogen cyanide
that you used on Wernick--

562
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,761
You didn't bring that
into the country.

563
00:31:43,763 --> 00:31:46,530
You bought that here
and mixed it yourself...

564
00:31:46,532 --> 00:31:48,449
Didn't you?

565
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:50,651
You're...

566
00:31:50,653 --> 00:31:52,185
Familiar with poisons?

567
00:31:52,187 --> 00:31:55,039
Oh, I've had some experience.

568
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,725
I have taken lives...

569
00:31:57,727 --> 00:32:00,211
Positioned on a wall...

570
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,195
With a rifle.

571
00:32:02,197 --> 00:32:04,915
Then the Stasi came calling.

572
00:32:04,917 --> 00:32:09,003
They said,
"your country needs you."

573
00:32:09,005 --> 00:32:11,672
They always say that.

574
00:32:11,674 --> 00:32:15,142
Hmm.

575
00:32:15,144 --> 00:32:18,896
For my country,
I left my country...

576
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:21,098
And killed wherever
they sent me.

577
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,435
For that,
I was called a monster.

578
00:32:24,437 --> 00:32:27,688
Even the blackest heart
still beats.

579
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,325
I was you, Kohl.

580
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:33,327
Revenge won't help.

581
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:36,580
24 years...

582
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:40,784
They kept me
buried in that hellhole.

583
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:43,170
I thought about nothing
but today.

584
00:32:43,172 --> 00:32:46,006
What about tomorrow?

585
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:50,127
I have to see her...

586
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:51,679
My Anja.

587
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:04,475
The brachial plexus
is a network of nerves.

588
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:09,029
Ulrich was always gone
for work,

589
00:33:09,031 --> 00:33:12,783
but when he was with me,
he loved me...

590
00:33:12,785 --> 00:33:14,368
And I loved him.

591
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,770
I was the wife of a spy.

592
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:20,074
I knew he couldn't talk
about what he did.

593
00:33:20,076 --> 00:33:21,492
Then one day he came home

594
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:23,794
and said the Stasi
had turned on him.

595
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:25,829
So then you fled
to the Soviet Union.

596
00:33:25,831 --> 00:33:27,798
He thought
it was still safe there.

597
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,051
We traveled separately.

598
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:34,588
That's when
the Americans found me.

599
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:37,257
Then they showed me photos.

600
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:40,227
Of all the assassinations.

601
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:44,181
I told myself
that he had lied first.

602
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,970
So much death...

603
00:33:49,972 --> 00:33:53,424
How could he?

604
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:54,858
The Americans staged

605
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,910
the car accident
to keep me safe.

606
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,580
Ulrich believed I was dead.

607
00:33:59,582 --> 00:34:02,616
But I started a new life.

608
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:12,126
This could take all night.

609
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,727
She has my mother's eyes.

610
00:34:29,729 --> 00:34:34,648
Don't do
anything stupid, Ulrich.

611
00:34:47,245 --> 00:34:49,663
You hid this?

612
00:34:53,868 --> 00:34:56,536
Her name is Marie.

613
00:34:56,538 --> 00:34:58,555
You're not a monster
to her yet.

614
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,808
It's too late for you and me,

615
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,143
but she could have
a normal life.

616
00:35:12,187 --> 00:35:14,405
How could
she keep this from me?

617
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:17,157
Anja--
How could she take...

618
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:21,561
How could they...
Take this girl from me?

619
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:24,698
That girl could have a chance.
Just leave her be.

620
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,786
As one professional
to another...

621
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:30,921
I respect
what you have tried to do,

622
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:32,873
but I can't have you
following me.

623
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,742
Wouldn't worry.
You aren't going anywhere.

624
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:42,516
Fusco, untie me.

625
00:35:44,886 --> 00:35:47,137
Where do you think he's going?

626
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,689
To find his daughter.

627
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:56,197
Oh, good night.

628
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,182
- See you later.
- Bye, you guys.

629
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:01,852
Have fun. Call me tomorrow.

630
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,128
Excuse me, miss.

631
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,030
Can you help me?
I'm looking for Lerner Hall.

632
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:16,501
Oh, yeah.
Sure, um...

633
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:22,306
You need to call your mother.

634
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:25,760
- Marie?
- Mom...

635
00:36:25,762 --> 00:36:30,431
There's a man here with me.
He wants to talk to you.

636
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,351
Kohl wants to meet in the park.

637
00:36:33,353 --> 00:36:35,236
He said he wouldn't hurt
the girl if his wife came alone.

638
00:36:35,238 --> 00:36:37,939
She's not going anywhere alone.

639
00:36:37,941 --> 00:36:39,240
Please don't hurt me.

640
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:41,159
I just need to speak
to your mother,

641
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:42,660
and then this will all be over.

642
00:36:42,662 --> 00:36:45,613
- How do you know her?
- From the past.

643
00:36:45,615 --> 00:36:48,449
I knew her.
I knew your father.

644
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,901
My father?

645
00:36:50,903 --> 00:36:54,038
Did your mother tell you
about him?

646
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,091
He was a soldier in Germany...

647
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:59,343
Before she moved here.

648
00:36:59,345 --> 00:37:00,595
He was a brave man.

649
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:04,348
He died before I was born.

650
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,883
He died a hero.

651
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:08,085
A hero?

652
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:12,473
After the Berlin wall fell,
he helped her get out.

653
00:37:12,475 --> 00:37:13,757
He helped her get free

654
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:17,895
so she and I could start
a life here.

655
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:19,897
Did you know my father?

656
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:22,366
I did...

657
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:25,119
Once.

658
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:26,454
All units be advised--

659
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:28,939
Possible abduction in
the vicinity of Central Park.

660
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:30,992
Perpetrator,
male, age 60-plus.

661
00:37:30,994 --> 00:37:34,045
Victim--
Female, age 23.

662
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:37,781
I'm really sorry about this...

663
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:42,386
More sorry
than you'll ever know.

664
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:45,556
Where is your friend?

665
00:37:45,558 --> 00:37:49,126
He's right here.

666
00:37:50,462 --> 00:37:52,980
Where you been?
We got an anonymous call.

667
00:37:52,982 --> 00:37:55,266
Our shooter's in the park?

668
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:56,400
If he's here,

669
00:37:56,402 --> 00:37:58,569
I got a feeling
my vigilante's here, too.

670
00:37:58,571 --> 00:37:59,654
Think we'll get them both?

671
00:37:59,656 --> 00:38:01,639
Why don't the two of you
go with him?

672
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,908
Come on.

673
00:38:06,978 --> 00:38:09,797
Why?

674
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,315
Why did you go?

675
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:15,536
I found out my husband
wasn't the man I married.

676
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:18,723
He was a killer.

677
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:22,593
I was trapped and pregnant.

678
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:27,965
I thought I knew him...

679
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,601
But they told me
he had become a monster.

680
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,353
Mom...

681
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:35,172
Who is this man?

682
00:38:37,842 --> 00:38:41,479
I was afraid of the person
you had become.

683
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:45,233
Can you forgive me
for the person I was?

684
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:47,652
I had to see your face...

685
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:54,458
To see both of your faces.

686
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:58,746
You told her
about her father--

687
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:00,481
That he was a hero,

688
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:03,701
that he saved you.

689
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:06,587
Without him...

690
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:09,473
We wouldn't have had
this life--

691
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:10,891
Either of us.

692
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:14,044
A part of me
has been with you always.

693
00:39:20,436 --> 00:39:23,154
Ulrich.

694
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,744
This is Carter--
Report.

695
00:39:29,746 --> 00:39:31,395
Who has a 20 on that shot?

696
00:39:32,832 --> 00:39:34,332
Are you all right?

697
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,951
Ulrich, no.

698
00:39:36,953 --> 00:39:38,736
No, no.

699
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:41,706
Finch, get them out of here.

700
00:39:44,677 --> 00:39:48,462
You were right to fear me.

701
00:39:48,464 --> 00:39:51,549
You were right.

702
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:03,427
Empty.

703
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:15,156
I wouldn't have hurt her.

704
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:22,112
I never had a tomorrow.

705
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,837
How did you know I'd shoot?

706
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,123
You are a soldier, like me.

707
00:40:37,512 --> 00:40:41,766
They took everything I had.

708
00:40:41,768 --> 00:40:45,469
But part of me survived.

709
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:48,989
It was...

710
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,858
Her.

711
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:04,288
All units, we've
located source of that shot.

712
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,957
Shooter--
Male, down, dead.

713
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:08,626
Bravo team leader, report in.

714
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,847
Who'd you think it was, Carter?

715
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:30,097
Harper.

716
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:34,068
No, not a Harper.

717
00:41:35,153 --> 00:41:37,037
I need you to dispose of this

718
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,489
and them.

719
00:41:38,491 --> 00:41:40,040
You didn't even question them.

720
00:41:40,042 --> 00:41:42,326
We don't have time
for questions--

721
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:44,578
Only answers.

722
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,665
These men took a bribe
to let a mass murderer escape.

723
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:52,503
How do we know it was them?

724
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:55,172
Anonymous source--

725
00:41:55,174 --> 00:41:58,509
Very reliable.

726
00:41:58,511 --> 00:42:00,811
You need to know this is right?

727
00:42:00,813 --> 00:42:04,515
I'll tell you one last time
before it gets complicated.

728
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,567
This is right.

729
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:09,620
The threat is real.

730
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:12,056
Your country needs you.

731
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:17,111
No teeth, no fingertips.

732
00:42:17,113 --> 00:42:19,830
One last thing...

733
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,735
You don't have any old friends.

734
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:26,871
You see them...

735
00:42:26,873 --> 00:42:29,540
You don't know them.

736
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:32,409
We're walking in the dark here,
you understand?

737
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:38,716
I think I've got it.

738
00:42:38,718 --> 00:42:39,767
You'll be...

739
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:42,753
Mr. Reese.

740
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:52,897
After all that,

741
00:42:52,899 --> 00:42:54,114
he goes in the ground

742
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,985
under a name
that isn't even his.

743
00:42:57,987 --> 00:43:01,104
The German government will sweep
the whole thing under the rug.

744
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:03,707
And Ulrich Kohl never existed.

745
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,609
I always thought I'd die

746
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:09,463
in a place
that didn't know my name.

747
00:43:09,465 --> 00:43:13,717
You think anyone
will care for our names?

748
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:17,221
After we're dead.

749
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:20,391
I thought we already were.

750
